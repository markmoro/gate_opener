Gate Opener
===========

This is a simple Arduino/iOS/web app to control an electric gate.   Requires the ethernet sheild and a bit of interface to the gate controls (I use a modified remote).


Status
------

This is in progress there is the basic Arduino sketch and some test code in the webapp folder.   

TODO
----

	- Add iOS app.   This will use geofencing to automatically open the gate as you get close
	- Webapp.   Simple web app to send the request.
